# Used Formula in IBM HR Dashboard:
- Total Employee Number:

        Total Employee Number = GETPIVOTDATA("EmployeeNumber",Insight!$A$2)
- Total Male Employee Number:

        Total Male Employee Number = GETPIVOTDATA("EmployeeNumber",Insight!$A$2,"Gender","Male")
- Total Female Employee Number:

        Total Female Employee Number = GETPIVOTDATA("EmployeeNumber",Insight!$A$2,"Gender","Female")
- Average Turnover Rate:

      Average Turnover Rate = Insight!H16

- Average Turnover Rate for Male:

        Average Turnover Rate for Male = Insight!H18 
- Average Turnover Rate for Female:

        Average Turnover Rate for Female = Insight!H16
- Average Age of the Employee:

        Average Age of the Employee = GETPIVOTDATA("Age",Insight!$A$14)
 - Average Age of Male:

        Average Age of Male = GETPIVOTDATA("Age",Insight!$A$14,"Gender","Male")
- Average Age of Female:

        Average Age of Female = GETPIVOTDATA("Age",Insight!$A$14,"Gender","Female")
